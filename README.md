Gunmetal
========

Gunmetal is a light and fast dependency-injection and application-modularisation tool for Java.

Nice things about Gunmetal:

    - enhancements to Java visibility and access modifiers to complement layered architectures
    - zero required dependencies
    - full JSR-330 support
    - generics injection, collection injection
    - fast build-deploy cycles
    - if you can wire it by hand, gunmetal can wire it 
    - extensibility through component post-processors, aspects, custom scopes
    - configurable enforcement and override options for programming to interfaces, acyclic graphs, etc
    - small, intuitive API for small learning curve and quickly ramping up teams for rapid development

The initial release of Gunmetal is tentatively targeted for some time in 2014.
