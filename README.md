Gunmetal
========

Gunmetal is a light and fast dependency-injection and application-modularisation tool for Java.

Nice things about Gunmetal:

    - enhancements to Java visibility and access modifiers to complement layered architectures and modularity
    - template graphs for blazing fast runtime injections
    - dynamic qualifiers for simple, traceable configuration reuse
    - zero required dependencies
    - full JSR-330 support
    - generics injection, collection injection
    - fast build-deploy cycles
    - if you can wire it by hand, gunmetal can wire it
    - extensibility through post-processors/provision-decorators and custom scopes
    - configurable enforcement and override options for programming to interfaces, acyclic graphs, etc
    - small, intuitive API for small learning curve and quickly ramping up teams for rapid development
    - highly flexible API for easily handling those pain-in-the-ass corner cases without hacks

Traceability & Simplicity -- Modularity & Visibility -- Speed & Power

The initial release of Gunmetal is tentatively targeted for some time in 2014.
